  <pre style = "color = white; text-align: right;">  Genshin Impact had a good year regarding its 
  nominations and results at The Game Awards 2021. 
  It was nominated for two awards and managed to 
  win one of them in the face of tough competition. 
  The two nominations were "Best Mobile Game" and 
  "Best Ongoing Game," with Genshin Impact only 
  winning the former.

  On September 28, 2020, the game was launched globally 
  for PC, iOS/Android, and PlayStation 4. On November 11, 2020, 
  a PlayStation 5 version was made available for play; it was 
  officially published on April 28, 2021, and includes cross-save 
  functionality with the PlayStation 4. On June 9, 2021, a second
  PC version was launched on the Epic Games Store. The game will 
  also be available on the Nintendo Switch.</pre>

    Final Fantasy XIV has won the Best Ongoing Game and 
    Best Community Support awards at The Game Awards 2021.

    The success of Final Fantasy XIV among MMORPG titles 
    came on the back of incredible content updates throughout 
    the years from Square Enix, the latest being the Endwalker 
    expansion, released on December 7.

    Since its release in 2013 as a replacement for the failed 
    2010 version, Final Fantasy XIV has remained Square Enixâ€™s 
    biggest money-maker. It has received four major expansion 
    packs: Heavensward (2015), Stormblood (2017), 
    Shadowbringers (2019), and Endwalker (2021).

    Directed and produced by Naoki Yoshida, Final Fantasy XIV 
    made a massive turnaround for the then-sinking Square Enix 
    in 2013. The title has since belonged to the upper echelons 
    of MMORPG titles, besides World of Warcraft, Guild Wars 2, etc.
